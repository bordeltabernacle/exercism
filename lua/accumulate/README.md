# Accumulate

Implement the `accumulate` operation, which, given a collection and an operation to perform on each element of the collection, returns a new collection containing the result of applying that operation to each element of the input collection.

Given the collection of numbers:

- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

And the operation:

- square a number (`x => x * x`)

Your code should be able to produce the collection of squares:

- 1, 4, 9, 16, 25

Check out the test suite to see the expected function signature.

## Restrictions

Keep your hands off that collect/map/fmap/whatchamacallit functionality
provided by your standard library!
Solve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.

Lisp specific: it's perfectly fine to use `MAPCAR` or the equivalent,
as this is idiomatic Lisp, not a library function.

### Getting started
#### MacOS
First install Lua and [Luarocks][2] using [Homebrew][1]:

```shell
$ brew install lua
```

Then install the [Busted][3] testing framework for Lua:

```shell
$ luarocks install busted
```

Then run your tests:

```shell
$ busted .
```

#### Ubuntu
First install Lua and [Luarocks][2] using [Apt][6]:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install lua5.3 luarocks
```

Then install the [Busted][3] testing framework for Lua:

```shell
$ luarocks install busted
```

If this fails, you may need to use `sudo`:

```shell
$ sudo luarocks install busted
```

Then run your tests:

```shell
$ busted .
```

#### Windows
First install Lua and [Luarocks][2] using [Chocolatey][7]:

```
C:\> choco install lua
```

Then install the [Busted][3] testing framework for Lua:

```
C:\> luarocks install busted
```

Then run your tests:

```
C:\> busted .
```
